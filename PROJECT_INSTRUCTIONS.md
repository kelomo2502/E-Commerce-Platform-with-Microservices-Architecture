# E-Commerce-Platform-with-Microservices-Architecture

## Hypothetical Use Case

You are tasked with developing an e-commerce platform using a microservices-based architecture. The platform consists of several microservices:

- Product Service: Manages product information.
- Cart Service: Handles user shopping cart.
- Order Service: Manages order processing.
The goal is to containerize these microservices using Docker, deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster managed by ArgoCD, and expose them through an API Gateway.
